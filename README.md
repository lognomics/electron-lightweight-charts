To setup the electron application: 

1. Make sure node & npm are installed... https://nodejs.org/en

2. Open a folder directory, in the directory terminal run:
   
    npm init -y
   
    npm install electron
   
    npm install lightweight-charts

3. This should setup your directory as you need it, you will see package.json & package-lock.json created in the folder.

4. Your package.json should look similar to this, & a reminder to change "main" link to "main.js".

5. Once you've completed these prior steps, add all the main commit branch files, whether you download or copy & paste.

6. Your directory folder should now look like this.

7. This is essentially a framework for beginnner & or lazy developers to get started without using React, working with core HTML & CSS.

8. Hope it helps, slapped this up -- will be updating as I care for it.
